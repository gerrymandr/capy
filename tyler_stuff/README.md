clustering propensity scores for demographic segregation

Work flow:

I am working using a similar framework to Emilia's code, so see her files if there are specifics about certain syntax choices of pulling shapefiles, turning them to .jsons, etc.

Ultimately, we want to get the relevent scores from 1990, 2000, and 2010.
